## Introduction

This repo contains mostly Data Science related resources and notebooks that I have used during my journey of learning 
and then re-learning the concepts of DS and ML.
The entire repository follows the same pattern:
* Level 1
  * The entry level structure contains the platform names
* Level 2
  * Contains the folders:
    * Data - Contains all the dataset and zipped files
    * Env - Contains the shareable environments
    * Notebooks - Contains all the notebooks for that specific section
    * Resources - Contains pdf, links, extra stuff for the section
    * Projects - Contains all the projects files for that specific section ( self-reliant, with datasets and everything 
  arranged in a specific manner)

### What can you expect from this repo
I have tried to simplify everything as much as I can (in terms of structuring) yet you will still find 
several folders with more than one technology used in it.
Due to the nature of data science itself more than one tech is a requirement for extracting a 
meaningful insight. 
In each notebook you will find code that covers the topic and an explanation which is personal to
me but should be good enough to make the topic clear.

Most of the stuff is just follow-ups on Udemy courses with minor descriptions still you can expect
some authentic work in the projects folders.
